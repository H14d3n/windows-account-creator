## Offline Account Creator

This Python script utilizes Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python, along with custom styling provided by the `customtkinter` module. 
It allows users to easily create offline accounts on a Windows system, without using compmgmt or similar programs.

I think you can see the clear winner here. Though I must admit, I didn't spend that much time with the TKinter version. ;D
